# Wordle Hack

## Overview

Wordle Hack is a tool designed to assist players in solving Wordle puzzles. It leverages algorithms and data analysis to suggest the best guesses based on the game's feedback, helping users improve their Wordle-solving skills.

## Features

- **Smart Guessing Algorithm**: Uses a combination of letter frequency and positional analysis to suggest the most likely words.
- **Feedback Analysis**: Integrates the game's feedback to refine guesses, narrowing down possible solutions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to use, with a simple command-line interface for input and output.

## Usage

To use the Wordle Hack tool, simply run the `WordleHack.py` script and follow the on-screen instructions. The program will prompt you for feedback after each guess, which it uses to refine its suggestions.

## Example

Here's a quick example of how to use the tool:

1. Start the program and enter the first word suggested.
2. Provide feedback (green, yellow, gray) based on the game's response.
3. Continue entering feedback after each guess until the word is solved.
